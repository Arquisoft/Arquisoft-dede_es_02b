|Quality requirement
|Quality scenario
|Priority

|Privacy
|Users' private data should be protected. For that, our application would only use the necessary data, and in a decentralized way.
|High

|Usability
|The users must be able to navigate through our application in a easy way.
|High

|Security
|The application has to be as secure as possible. User's data should not be lent to a third party.
|High

|Availability
|Users need to be able to access to the system whenever they want to.
|Medium-High

|Maintainability
|The application code should be written in a way that it can be modified and reused in a easy way. Also, is important that the system's errors can be solved easily.
|Medium

|Compatibility
|Our system should be able to work with the same users' decentralized data that can be used on other applications.
|Medium

|Portability
|The application must be correctly deployed regardless of whether it is running on a computer, mobile phone or tablet.
